## 🛠️ Features

- **Real-time palindrome detection**
- **Clean input processing** (removes non-alphanumeric characters)
- **Color-coded results** (green for palindrome, red for non-palindrome)
- **Responsive design** for all devices
- **Keyboard support** (Enter key functionality)
- **Accessible UI** with clear feedback
- Built with **vanilla JavaScript**, **HTML5**, and **CSS3**

---

## 💡 How It Works

- **Input cleaning** using regex: `/[^a-z0-9]/g`
- **Palindrome comparison** using array reversal
- **DOM manipulation** for dynamic result display
- **Event listeners** for click and keyboard interactions
- **Conditional styling** based on validation results

---

## 🎯 Learning Objectives

This project demonstrates:
- JavaScript string manipulation and regex
- Array methods (reverse, join)
